# H1Bvisa

Context

America is still a land of opportunities for those who have a unique technical background and are lucky in a lottery.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) states in their H1-B Program webpage:

"U.S. businesses use the H-1B visa program to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require the theoretical or
practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, including but not limited to: scientists, engineers, or computer programmers." (USCIS, 2019). 

And even for those who would be eligible, there is a cap. For 2022, the USCIS has announced that they will only grant 65,000 H1-B visas,
plus an additional 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the masterâ€™s cap.
They began receiving applications for the Fiscal Year of 2023 on April 1, 2022,
and employers/candidates can file an H1-B petition no more than six months before the employment start date.

The cap of 65,000 is only applied to the number of visas granted. There is no cap on the number of applications.
This means that employers submit applications for as many positions as they wish to hire a foreigner that fulfills the criteria.
A lottery is then applied to randomly decide who gets a work visa. 
As early as April 5, 2022 - five days after the FY2020 application process began, the USCIS announced having received enough H-1B petitions
to reach the statutory cap of 65,000 visas.

The data behind the H1B applications -including position, function, location, and salary- are made available publicly by the USCIS.
